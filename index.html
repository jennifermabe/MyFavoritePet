            <p>Let's do that again. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. Let that brush dance around there and play. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us.</p>
            <p>How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. Play with the angles. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. We need dark in order to show light. Only eight colors that you need. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.</p>
            <p>Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Just let these leaves jump off the brush We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow.</p>
